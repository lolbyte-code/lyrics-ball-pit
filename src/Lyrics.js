We're all looking for someone, that perfect girl
Who can take our hand and help us see the world
But I'm a little unusual, because you see
I seek a different type of thrill for my romantic fantasy
And I must say
I'm looking your way
And you seem to like me, baby
And you give me all the signs
There's just one activity on my mind
Do you wanna do nothing with me?
Do you wanna do nothing with me?
Do you wanna do nothing with me?
Do you wanna do nothing with me?
Do you wanna do something with me tonight?
I'll put on my finest sweatpants and I'll order you pad thai
We'd be livin' our dreams, as our love grows
What an intimate occasion, you and me and HBO
'Til morning light, so wrong yet so right
So say you want it, darling
'Cause you know I want it too
And there's just one thing that I wanna do
Do you wanna do nothing with me?
Do you wanna do nothing with me?
Do you wanna do nothing with me?
Do you wanna do nothing with me?
Oh, oh, let's talk it through
In case you're confused
'Cause I know I can seem lazy
From these things I like to do
But they're only worth it when I'm with you
Yeah, it's true, so do you
Wanna do nothing with me?
Oh, do you wanna do nothing with me?
Do you wanna do nothing with me?
Do you wanna do nothing with me?
